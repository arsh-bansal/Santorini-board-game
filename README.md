# 🏛️ Santorini Board Game

Welcome to **Santorini**, a strategy-based board game reimagined in Python!  
This project is a digital recreation of the award-winning board game where players compete to build towers and outwit their opponents using special god powers.

## 🎯 Objective

Be the first player to move one of your workers to the **third level** of a tower — but beware, each player may wield **unique god powers** that can alter the rules of play!

  - **Demeter** – Build twice (not on the same space)  
  - **Zeus** – Build beneath your current worker

## 🧱 How to Play

1. **Place Workers** – Each player gets two workers placed randomly on the board.  
2. **Take Turns** – On your turn:
   - Move one of your workers to an adjacent space.
   - Build one level in an adjacent space.
   - Use your **god power** if available.
3. **Win the Game** – Move your worker onto the **3rd level** of any tower to win!

> If you're using a God Power, its special rule will modify your standard actions.
